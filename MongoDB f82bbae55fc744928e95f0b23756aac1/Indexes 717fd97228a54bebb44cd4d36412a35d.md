# Indexes

MongoDB use indexing in order to make the query processing more efficient.

**If there is no indexing, then the MongoDB must scan every document in the collection** and retrieve only documents that match the query.

Indexes are a special data structures that stores some information related to the documents such that it becomes easy for MongoDb to find the right data file. The indexes are order by the value of the field specified in the index.

### Why Indexes?

### Donâ€™t use Too many index

The big advantage of the indexes is that they permit the queries, updates and deletes to run as fast as possible if they are used. Unfortunately, the indexes require some extra work for MongoDB. 

**Any time you run a write, all the indexes must be updated.**

The main problem is that:

- **More indexes you have in a collection, the slower all the writes will be**

### Evaluating Index Usage

The `explain("executionStats")` method return information how the is performed. 

- Example:

```jsx
db.contacs.explain("executionStats").find({"dob.age": {$gt: 60}})
```

This operation returns a lot of information:

```jsx
...
queryPlanner: {
		...
    winningPlan: {
      stage: 'COLLSCAN',
	    ...
    },
    rejectedPlans: []
  },
  executionStats: {
    ...
    nReturned: 1222,
    executionTimeMillis: 4,
    totalKeysExamined: 0,
    totalDocsExamined: 5000,
		...
  },
...
```

### Create a single Field index

```jsx
db.contacs.createIndex({"dob.age": 1})
```

---

### Create a compound index

```jsx
db.collection.createIndex( { <field1>: <type>, <field2>: <type2>, ... } )
```

- **Example:**

```jsx
db.contacs.createIndex({"dob.age": 1, gender: 1})
```

**The order of the fields in a compound index is important.**

The index will contain references to documents sorted first by the values of `dob.age` field and, within each value of `dob.age` field, sorted by values of the `gender` field.

In addition to supporting queries that match all the indexes fields, compound indexes can support queries that match on the prefix of the index fields. that is, the index support queries on the `dob.age` field as well as both `dob.age` and `gender`

### Creating Unique Index

```jsx
db.contacs.createIndex({email: 1}, {unique: true})
```

---

### Partial Indexes

Partial indexes only index the documents in a collection that meet a specified filter expression. By indexing a subset of the documents in a collection, partial index have lower storage requirements and reduced performance costs for index creation and maintenance. 

- **Example:**

```jsx
db.contacs.createIndex({"dob.age": 1}, {partialFilterExpression: {gender: "male" }})
```

### Get indexes of a collection

```jsx
db.contacs.getIndexes();
```
