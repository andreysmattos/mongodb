# $out

Takes the documents returned by the aggregation pipeline and writes them to a specified collections.

- The `$out` stage must be the last stage in the pipeline

**Example:**

```jsx
db.persons.aggregate([
  {
    $project: {
      _id: 0,
      name: {
        $concat: ["$name.first", " ", "$name.last"]
      },
      age: "$dob.age"
    }    
  },
  {
      $out: "summaryPersons" // Output collection is in the same database
  }
]);
```
