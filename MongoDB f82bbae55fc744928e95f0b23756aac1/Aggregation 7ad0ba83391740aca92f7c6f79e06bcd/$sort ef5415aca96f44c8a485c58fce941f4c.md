# $sort

Sort all input documents and return them to the pipeline in sorted order.

| 1 | Ascending |
| --- | --- |
| -1 | Descending |

If sorting on multiple field, sort order is evaluated from left to right. For example: Documents with the same `<field1>` values are further sorted by `<field2>`.

**Example:**

```jsx
db.persons.aggregate([{ $sort: { "registered.date": -1 } }]);
```
