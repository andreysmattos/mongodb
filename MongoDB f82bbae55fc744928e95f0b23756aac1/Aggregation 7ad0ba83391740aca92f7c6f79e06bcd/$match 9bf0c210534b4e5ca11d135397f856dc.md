# $match

Filters the documents to pass only the documents that match the specified condition(s) to the next pipeline stage.

The query syntax is identical to the read operation **query.**

**Example:**

```jsx
db.persons.aggregate([
  {
    $match: { gender: "female", "location.city": "cashel" },
  },
]);
```
